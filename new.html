                    Happy anniversary <b>BABYY!!</b> It's official now that we've been together for a <u>YEAR!</u><br>
                    I am so happy and grateful to be with you this long, even when we've gone through tough times together.<br>
                    I still love you for your personality, beauty, and you as a whole.<br>
                    I even think you got prettier over time!<br>
                    You still surprise me with your dresses, all of them look very beautiful in you!<br>
                    And your makeup still astonishes me, always have to urge to kiss your face but I have to control myself...
                </p>
                <p>
                    I will help you when you're in the need of help, or when you're down.<br>
                    Even when we get far away from each other, I'll still be there for you.<br>
                    Even when the problem is tough for me, I'll try to still help you.<br>
                    No matter what the situation is, I'll always be there for you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let's keep making good memories together, the ones that last long in our minds and heart.<br>
                    I love you the most and I love you forever CJ.
